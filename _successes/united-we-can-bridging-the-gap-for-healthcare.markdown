We had a great rally for healthcare in Louisville. Those of us on the Indiana side marched across the Big Four Bridge and met our fellow activists from the Kentucky side. Dan Canon, who recently declared his candidacy for representative for the 9th district, spoke to the assembled crowd. He is hoping to come to one of our JCI meetings soon!
