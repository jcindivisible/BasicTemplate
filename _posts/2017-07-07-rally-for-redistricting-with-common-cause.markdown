Although the 2018 General Assembly is more than six months away, we’re hard at work building support for legislation to reform redistricting. When Rep. Milo Smith, Chair of the House Elections Committee, squashed our chances for reform earlier this year by refusing to give HB 1014 a vote he lit a fire underneath our supporters. Instead of allowing frustration to get the best of us, we’ve channeled it into energy!

It’s exciting how many of you have been engaged and are working with us to educate the public and build grassroots support. We are really making progress!

WHAT: Rally for Redistricting Reform
WHEN: Monday, July 17, noon – 1 p.m. 
WHERE: Indiana State House, 200 W. Washington St, Indianapolis, South Steps

To celebrate that forward momentum, and to keep it building, I hope you will join us for a redistricting reform rally on Monday, July 17th at noon at the State House in Indianapolis. 

Why July 17th? It’s the birthday of the father of gerrymandering, former Vice-President and Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and therefore, the perfect opportunity for us to call for end to manipulating political district for partisan political advantage. 

We’ll have a few speeches from leaders in the reform movement, we’ll play some games – including “pin the tail on the gerrymander monster”, and we’ll gather signatures on petitions. Most importantly, there will be cake!
Although Elbridge Gerry died in 1814, his legacy lives on in Indiana. Let’s commemorate his birthday with a renewed commitment to reform redistricting in our state before the next round takes place in 2021. 

Hope to see you at the State House on July 17th!
