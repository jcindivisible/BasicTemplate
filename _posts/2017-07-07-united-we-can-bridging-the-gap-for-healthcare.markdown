Hello friends and fellow activists!

Please plan to attend our event: Bridging the Gap For Healthcare! Come join SoINdivisible and Indivisible Ky as they rally together to demand that KY Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, and IN Senators Todd Young and Joe Donnelly vote NO on the Senate's proposed "Better Care Act". McConnell has delayed the vote, but make no mistake, he's wheeling and dealing trying to bribe fellow Senators into voting yes. We must act NOW to make sure our voices are heard. 

We'll meet at the bottom of the Big Four Bridge, So indivisible on the Indiana side, and Indivisible Ky on the Kentucky side, and then we'll meet in the middle to "Bridge The Gap", and stand together, INDIVISIBLE, against this horrible so-called healthcare bill. Bring your signs, your raised voices and your energy.
